## Summary

The expense application allowed me to further my grasp of the core concepts of the DOM, and how to manipulate
data to get the desired result. Creating the table and appending/removing rows was cool to see in action. Getting 
the table rows deleted from the delete button click event was a little challenging at first, but once I started using
debugging in the development tools it became crystal clear. Using the developemt tools to see where the elements were
positioned on the page helped me further to manipulate them within JavaScript, and traversing the DOM in the table. This 
was a fun experience and I learned a great deal by implementation.
